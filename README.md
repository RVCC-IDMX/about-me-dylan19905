Description:
The purpose of this project was to learn the basic skills and ideas used when developing a website. Some skills that we learned in particular order consisted of embedding images, and changing different layouts of items on the page like how a paragraph was laid out for example. We also learned the basic structure of HTML and how to add to it with things like changing the title, creating footers, and creating sections within the page. One other important thing we did with CSS was manipulating text. This consisted of aligning the text, changing the font, the font size, and much more.

Color Scheme:
Originally the color scheme of my About Me was very random and all over the place, however in the end I decided to go with a blue theme. I think the blue theme looks presentable in comparison to every color on the spectrum on my page. It feels a lot more organized with a theme of blue all in all. One thing I learned and came to like with the hex codes was that there was a slider that let me select the type of blue I wanted. This made it much easier than going on a website and going down a little rabbit hole to get a hex code with the shade of blue I like. But it is nice there are resources like that on the internet. One part of the project I liked, in particular, was the way the light blue background looks with the black nav bar. This may be partly because black goes with any color but regardless I think they sync nicely together.

Nav Bar:
The Nav Bar for me ultimately took me the longest to learn. I am pleased with it and if I am going, to be honest, I watched too many guides on how to 
do it. I tried to replicate one of the videos I found on YouTube but tried and change it up a little bit. It was hard for me to get the icons to disappear and almost merge it seems like. One thing I enjoyed about this however was that it had me use a lot of things outside of the class and go on forums like Reddit and stack overflow to find some of the things I was looking for.
