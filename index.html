        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <div>
            <p>From a young age I spent a lot of time in front of a computer screen. When I was much younger and did not possess a lot of knowledge about computers and no money as well, often times I would try and download 
                games on our home computer. One of the games I wanted to play but did not have was Minecraft. I spent so much time trying to get Minecraft for free on this computer. I think somewhere down the line my parents may have bought me it 
                but at some point to me it was about trying to get this game for free without having to pay. It was fun. I remember watching a plentiful amount of YouTube videos and visiting so many random websites. Somewhere down the line, I realized 
                that the computer was not loading as fast as it did at one point. So I got off the computer. A couple hours later I heard my dad yell for my name. I came to the computer room and got put on blast. He scolded me for putting so many viruses on the
                computer. At the time I did not really care or understand what he was trying to tell me. I did not even know what a virus was but he then told me he was not going to fix the computer or at the time he told me he was just going to leave it and let 
                it stay slow. So I tasked myself with figuring out how to fix it for myself and I did. Since then I realized that there was so much power that computers held. I found out not only can I download games for free but also music and movies.
                After tampering with this for so long and as I grew older and saved some money up I learned how to build a computer and install operating systems. I only learned more from there on. Now I am at the point where I feel comofortable dealing with
                many issues a computer has. But now I want to learn how to do things like code and build websites because I want to do things like that career wise.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In terms of hobbies, I would say I have a few. I enjoy playing games with my friends on the computer with them as well as hanging out with them in person somewhere as well.
            I also like to play basketball with them a lot. Basketball is a sport I have played for a while. I was never too competitive with it but I love to shoot. I can shoot a basketball for hours before getting bored or tired.
            I also work a part time job at a gym. I work at a gym called Life Time but in the gym I work at the cafe. At the cafe I do things mainly in the kitchen. For example I make sandwiches for people and protein shakes occasionally but I also prep a lot of the food.
            I also use the gym there a lot of the time after I work. I am not incredibly strong but I think it's something to do.

            <p>“Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not enough for me. Here I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not—and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long master that I would be master still—or at least that none other should be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation;
                 and I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand.”</p>

        <h2>Panthers</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The term "panther" is a generic name often used to describe large, powerful big cats belonging to the Panthera genus. This group includes the lion (Panthera leo), tiger (Panthera tigris), jaguar (Panthera onca),
                     and leopard (Panthera pardus). While the name "panther" is commonly associated with black panthers, which are melanistic variants of leopards and jaguars, it can be used more broadly to refer to any big cat within the Panthera genus.
                    One of the most iconic members of the Panthera genus is the black panther, renowned for its sleek, melanistic coat that appears pitch-black but often reveals faint rosettes upon closer inspection.
                     These enigmatic felines are not a distinct species but rather melanistic forms of leopards and jaguars. The melanism is caused by a genetic mutation that results in an excess of dark pigmentation.
                     Despite their dark appearance, black panthers are capable of exhibiting the same rosette patterns as their non-melanistic counterparts.
                    Jaguars, native to the Americas, are among the largest big cats and are known for their robust build and distinctive golden-yellow coat adorned with dark rosettes and spots. The melanistic variant of the jaguar, often 
                    referred to as the "black jaguar" or "black panther," is a formidable and stealthy hunter in the dense jungles of South and Central America. Jaguars are known for their powerful bite, capable of piercing the skulls or
                     shells of their prey with ease.
                    Leopards, found in Africa and parts of Asia, are characterized by their slender build and striking coat patterns. The typical leopard coat consists 
                    of golden-yellow fur adorned with dark rosettes and spots, providing excellent camouflage in their natural habitats. The melanistic variant, known as the black panther, is more commonly found in Asian leopard populations.
                     Leopards are known for their adaptability and can thrive in a variety of environments, from savannas to dense forests.
                    Tigers, the largest of the big cats, are native to various parts of Asia. Their distinctive orange coat with black stripes serves as effective camouflage in their natural habitats, which range from dense jungles to open grasslands.
                     Tigers are solitary creatures, known for their strength, agility, and powerful hunting skills. While melanistic tigers have been reported, they are extremely rare, and the genetic basis for melanism in tigers is not well understood.
                    Lions, the only big cats that live in social groups known as prides, are native to Africa and parts of Asia. The male lion is easily recognizable by its luxurious mane, while the female is typically smaller and lacks the mane. Lions 
                    are apex predators and are known for their cooperative hunting strategies within the pride. They have a powerful roar that can be heard over long distances, serving as a means of communication with other members of the pride.
                    The term "panther" evokes a sense of mystery and power, capturing the essence of these majestic big cats. Whether it's the stealthy black panther prowling through the dense rainforests or the regal lion leading its pride across the 
                    African savanna, panthers embody the grace, strength, and beauty that have captivated human fascination for centuries. Despite the challenges they face in the wild, including habitat loss and poaching, efforts to conserve and protect these magnificent creatures are ongoing to ensure their survival for future generations to marvel at their awe-inspiring presence in the natural world.
